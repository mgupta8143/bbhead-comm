# Basketball Head (BBHead)

BBHead is a live-time chatting application for NBA fans who want some buddies to watch a game with! The application opens rooms (as shown on the left) of current live game rooms 
where users can chat. Fans can engage in the chat as guests or otherwise register and login.



This application was built using Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, MongoDB, and the EJS templating engine. The application was deployed on Heroku.
