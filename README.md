## What is BBHead?
BBHead is a chatting application that automatically opens NBA game rooms as the games occur live time. The hope is that NBA fans who want to have discussion
during a game with ohers can do easily using BBHead.

## How does BBHead Work?
Fans can join different NBA game rooms and chat on them. BBHead pulls data from online sources to find when games are occuring and will open new rooms at an undisclosed time daily. Fans can talk either as guests or register for full-fledged accounts.

This application was built using Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, MongoDB, and the EJS templating engine. The application was deployed on Heroku. 

## How to Use BBHead
* Go to this link https://bbhead-comm.herokuapp.com/
* Then, click a game on the left (if there are no games, either reload the page or check if there are any games on currently)
* From there, you can engage in the chat as you like!

## Potential Improvements
* The app can be made more responsive
* Adding effects in game chats by the application whenever players scores/assists/rebounds
* Adding confetti effects when a game is done with a score board in the black zone above the chat
* Creating effects whenever the lead changes.
* Adding an in-depth friend/profile system
